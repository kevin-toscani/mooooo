# Mooooo!

Mooooo! (with five o's, previously six) is my first ever NES game made
with NESmaker. I've decided to open source this project, so everyone can
see what I did and how I did it.

I'm by no means an expert at NESmaker, so although beginners might learn
a thing or two while sniffing through this project, I'm open to tips,
tricks and advice from more experienced NESmakers.

## Story

You are a cow. A hungry cow. In fact, you are so hungry, you need to eat
all the grass you can find. You progress to the next level when you have
eaten all the grass on the screen. But don't get stuck on rocks, trees,
or your ever-growing body.

## Controls
Press A to start the game. Use the D-pad to navigate the cow through the
field. If you get stuck, you can reset the level using the B-key.

## This is a demo
The demo contains 20 levels. The final version features a story mode
with 100 levels, and four season modes with ~50 levels each. I hope
you enjoy the demo and love to hear what you think!

## Thanks
Thanks go out to the NESmakers forum users that playtested my game
and/or provided me with some pointers, advice and motivation to keep
working on the game. In no particular order, shout out to: Basty,
chronicleoflegends, CutterCross, dale_coop, jim, JollyShadow, Jonny,
Logana, mouse spirit and TakuikaNinja.

And of course the biggest shout out (which I almost forgot, shame on me)
goes out to The New 8 Bit Heroes, for providing me with a tool which
allows me to make my childhood dreams from thirty-something years ago
come true! Joe Granato is a boss.
